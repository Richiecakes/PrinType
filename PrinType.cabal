-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
synopsis:            A principal typing system for the simply typed lambda calculus.

-- A longer description of the package.
description:         
  PrinType is a small library for generating typing proofs in the simply typed lambda calculus. It also aims to provide a command line tool for generating and exporting such proofs in a variety of formats.
  .
  __Planned features include:__
  .
  * A parser for inputting lambda expressions from the command line.
  For example, Lxyz.xz(yz)
  * A library of common combinators.
  * ASCII proof output.
  * LaTeX proof output.
  * Customisable proof formats and preferences.
  For example, use numbers for type variables (1 => 2) or capital letters (A => B).
  * Informative result for untypbable terms exaplaining why the term is not typbable.
  * Verbose options for logging operation of typing algorithm and type unification.
